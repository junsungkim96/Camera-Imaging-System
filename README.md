# Camera Imaging System
This repository contains code for simulating a camera imaging system. The pipeline includes illuminant, scene, optics, sensor, isp (image signal processing) and object detection.
It is based on physical principles of cameras such as the spectrum of light, reflectance of surface, diffraction of light when passed through optics, opto-electronic effect at the sensors etc.
